      q: "Do you store prompts or model outputs?",
      a: "By default we operate in a zero-retention posture for prompts and outputs. You can optionally enable short-lived retention for audit purposes, scoped by policy and region.",
    },
    {
      q: "Where is data processed and stored?",
      a: "We support region routing (EU/US/UK) and keep processing and any optional retention in-region. Backups follow the same residency constraints.",
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle PII and secrets?",
      a: "Inline detectors redact PII (emails, names, phone numbers, addresses) and secrets (API keys, tokens) before they leave your tenant, with policy-based allow/deny rules.",
    },
    {
      q: "Are you SOC 2 / GDPR compliant?",
      a: "We align to SOC 2 controls and GDPR requirements. DPA and SCCs are available on request. Refer to the Compliance section on this page for current attestations.",
    },
    {
      q: "Do you support SSO and provisioning?",
      a: "Yes. SAML SSO and SCIM are available on Growth and Enterprise plans. Role-based access control governs approvals and audit visibility.",
    },
    {
      q: "Can approvers release blocked prompts?",
      a: "Yesâ€”sensitive events can be escalated to approvers via Human-in-the-Loop. Approved content is logged with full audit trail.",
